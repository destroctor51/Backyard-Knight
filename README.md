Backyard Knight
============
This is an action plataformer game, in which you play as a boy who has an incredible imagination and a cranky neighbour. The story starts when your neighbour, irritated by your dog's barking, decides to kidnap it. Now it's the boy's duty to save his friend!

During the game, the main character will fight various enemies in each of the three levels of the tower. And at the top you'll find the Boss, his neighbour. On the way, you'll find different weapons and items, which have distinct characteristis and effects. However, you can only care one item and one weapon at a time. Those objects can be found in chests, which you can choose to open or not. But if you happen to open one, you'll be forced to exchange your current weapon or item for what's in the chest.
Your score will be determined by the enemies you kill and how fast you get to your dog. At the end you can choose to submit your score.
